# Is Strong?
**Is Strong?** it's a technical test where I using **React**,  and **Styled Components**, and **Jest**, and **Enzyme**...
I opted out don't use **Redux** or **Redux-Saga** to control the **states**.
In that example form, we have a component from validate a password strength, where we pass props like: min characters, max characters, enable compare password, etc.
